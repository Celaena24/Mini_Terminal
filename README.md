# 326_Mini_Terminal

**Project Team 1 (Online)**

## Project Description

- **Problems:**
    1. Large universities, like UMass, usually provide ssh server environments, like EdLab, for students to get familiar
       with Linux-styled commands. However, most students only use the most basic features on EdLab, so the power
       assumption
       and the continuous maintenance cost are not worth it.
       Students, who are not enrolled in a university and have no previous experience in installing and using Linux,
       usually
       find it hard to install a Linux distribution on their PCs.
    2. Update the UI so that the page looks modern.

- **Solutions:**
    1. A terminal simulator, which can be accessed on web browsers and run on local devices (phones, tablets, and PCs),
       can perfectly solve this problem.
    2. Do some research online and Switch to better design.

- **Key Features:**
    - The terminal simulator will support the most usual Linux commands, like ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, rename, touch, cp,
      edit. It has file managing system simulations.
    - Additionally, we can set up additional buttons outside the terminal window to support log-saving,
      file-system-importing, and file-system-exporting. So, people can easily save and resume their work efficiently.
    - We can implement customizable themes allowing users to switch between different color schemes (dark mode, light
      mode, etc.)
    - Store previously entered commands and allow users to cycle through them using the up/down arrow keys.
    - Finally, if time allows, the terminal will have supports for Web Assembly, so the terminal can be used to program
      new programs.

- **Why This Project?**
  The “Web Terminal Simulator” also is a great application to implement. Using EdLab has been a task at many points.
  Logging in everytime through the terminal followed by verification can become frustrating when you repeatedly want to
  access your files and resume your work after a short break.
