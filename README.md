# 326_Mini_Terminal

## Team Number
**Project Team 1 (Online)**

## Project Description
- **Problem:**
Large universities, like UMass, usually provide ssh server environments, like EdLab, for students to get familiar with Linux-styled commands. However, most students only use the most basic features on EdLab, so the power assumption and the continuous maintenance cost are not worth it. 
Students, who are not enrolled in a university and have no previous experience in installing and using Linux, usually find it hard to install a Linux distribution on their PCs. 

  
- **Solution:**
    - ...
- **Key Features:**
    - The terminal simulator will support the most usual Linux commands, like ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, rename, touch, cp, edit. It has file managing system simulations.
    - Additionally, we can set up additional buttons outside the terminal window to support log-saving, file-system-importing, and file-system-exporting. So, people can easily save and resume their work efficiently.
    - Finally, if time allows, the terminal will have supports for Web Assembly, so the terminal can be used to program new programs.
